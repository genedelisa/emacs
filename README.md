emacs
=====

These are my init files for the Emacs. They live in ~/.emacs.d on my computers.
This particular set started with the Emacs starter kit https://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit
Following the ESK, gene.mackbook.el and rocco.home.el are customizations for my computers. The subdirectory
"gene" is my user name, so the ESK will read its contents. Of course, change these to your own names.

In particular, this set up is geared towards Clojure. Create a lein project, navigate to it, then
type M-x clojure-jack-in.

The JDE init worked in the past. JDE hasn't caught up to current Emacs releases yet.

There are also many things that I've used over the past few decades of using Emacs. Some still
need to be updated and others are in progress.

I've removed init files that had personal information in them. Let me know if that caused any of this to not work.
